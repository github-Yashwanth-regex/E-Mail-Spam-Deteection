# E-Mail-Spam-Deteection
Email spam detection with machine learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset of emails (spam and non-spam) to learn patterns and features that distinguish between the two. The model then applies these learned patterns to classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate based on their content, sender, and other characteristics.
